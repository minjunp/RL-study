Edit below files:
- core/deep_q_learning_torch.py
- core/q_learning.py

## Starter Code
http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/assignments/assignment2/starter_code_torch.zip

## Notes
Will use Q-learning with function approximators (deep Q-network) to play games!
Will use Open AI gym for the Atari environment
Takes more than 8 hours for Pong to train

## Objectives
understand the basic Q-learning method.
understand the use of experience replay , target network and the selection of hyperparameter tuning.
implement and apply a linear approximator on the Pong game.
implement and apply the DQN on the Pong game.
understand the differences and tradeoffs between these two approximators.
